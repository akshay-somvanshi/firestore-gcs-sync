# Firestore to GCS JSON Export Script

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script that automates the export of Firestore data to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) in a readable **JSON format**.

Firestoreâ€™s built-in export command produces metadata-encoded files that are not human-readable and are designed for database imports or BigQuery ingestion.  
This script addresses that limitation by:
- Querying documents directly from Firestore (e.g., from a `messages` collection)  
- Converting them to JSON  
- Uploading the resulting file to a GCS bucket  

The goal is to maintain a daily backup of Firestore message history in GCS for analysis, auditing, or recovery.
